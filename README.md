# GlamourGem Product Listing Page


This project implements a product listing page for an e-commerce website called GlamourGem. The page allows users to view and filter products by various categories, colors, and price ranges. Users can also sort products based on different criteria. When a product is added to the cart, a notification popup is displayed.

## Technologies Used


- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


The project also utilizes the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and UI components.


## Features Implemented


- Display products: Products are fetched from a JSON data source and displayed on the page. Each product is shown with its image, name, description, price, and ratings.


- Filter products: Users can filter products by color and price range. The color and price filters update the displayed products accordingly.


- Sort products: Users can sort products based on alphabetical order (A-Z or Z-A) and price (ascending or descending).


- Load more products: The "Load More" button allows users to load additional products as they scroll down the page.


- Mobile-friendly design: The page is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.


- Notification popup: When the "Add to Cart" button is clicked, a notification popup appears indicating that the product has been added to the cart.


## Challenges


- **JavaScript Implementation**: The main challenge was implementing the JavaScript functionality for filtering, sorting, and handling user interactions. This included updating the displayed products based on user selections and creating the notification popup.


- **Responsive Design**: Designing a responsive layout that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices required careful consideration of CSS rules and handling different screen sizes.


- **Integration with JSON Data**: Integrating the product data from a JSON source involved fetching and parsing the data, as well as dynamically generating product cards.
